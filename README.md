# Remote Code Execution Engine

A robust, scalable asynchronous code execution platform inspired by systems like LeetCode, Judge0, and HackerRank.
This engine securely executes user-submitted code inside isolated Docker sandboxes, managed through a modern microservices architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The system uses a Producer–Consumer model for fault tolerance and scalability.
The API never directly executes code; instead, it offloads jobs to RabbitMQ, and Workers asynchronously execute them inside Docker containers.

## Key Components
* Component	Tech	Responsibility
* Ingress Gateway	NGINX	Reverse-proxy, routing, load balancing
* API Service	Node.js (Express)	Receives jobs, validates input, pushes tasks to RabbitMQ
* RabbitMQ	Message Broker	Job queueing + backpressure
* Worker Service	Node.js	Consumes tasks, executes code in Docker
* Sandbox Runtime	Docker	Isolated container execution (network disabled, limited resources)
* Redis	Cache	Stores job states: Pending → Processing → Completed

## Features
1.Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, Bash)

2.Full sandboxing via Docker

3.No network access inside containers (--network none)

4.Resource limits (128MB RAM, 1 CPU core)

5.Persistent RabbitMQ queue (crash-safe)

6.Horizontal scalability (docker-compose up --scale worker=5)

7.Fast result fetching through Redis


## Security Measures

* Isolated execution inside ephemeral containers
* Network disabled containers
* Timeout-based execution kill (prevents infinite loops)
* Memory + CPU limits
* Base64 encoded user code to prevent command injection
* Strict validation for incoming payloads


## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
1.Docker
2.Docker Compose

```
1️. Clone the Project
git clone https://github.com/ningaraddi-raddi/Remote-Code-Executor.git
cd Remote-Code-Executor

```

2️. Run All Services

Start API, Worker, Redis, RabbitMQ, and the Gateway:
```
docker-compose up --build

```

All services are available via:

http://localhost:8080

🔌 API Documentation
1. Submit Code for Execution

Endpoint:
POST /api/execute


Request Body:
```
{
  "language": "python",
  "code": "print('Hello from the sandbox!')"
}

```
Response:
```
{
  "jobId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "Pending",
  "message": "Job submitted successfully"
}
```
2. Check Job Status
```
Endpoint:
GET /api/status/:jobId

Response (Processing)
{ "status": "Processing" }

Response (Completed)
{
  "status": "Completed",
  "output": "Hello from the sandbox!\n",
  "submittedAt": "2025-11-30T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### How It Works (Simplified)
* User submits code → API validates request
* API generates jobId and sets job as Pending in Redis
* API pushes job to RabbitMQ
* Worker pulls job → Creates a Docker sandbox
* Code executes with limited CPU/RAM
* Worker updates Redis with job result
* User polls /api/status/:jobId for output

### Future Improvements

 WebSockets for real-time logs

 Warm Docker container pools (faster execution)

 JWT-based authentication & rate limiting

 More languages (C++, Java, Go, Rust)

 Multi-file project execution

 Per-user execution quotas
